A final project for the IP Spatial Data Infrastructures by Martin Stobbelaar and Edah Sahinovic. 

The primary objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the migration patterns associated with Germany, illustrated through interactive dashboards for each unique direction of movement. In addition, the impact of these migrations on the population figures within the nation was investigated.
